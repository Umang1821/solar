    <img src="./images/solar.jpg" alt="solar system">
    <p>The Solar System[b] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.[c] Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets,[d] with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.[e]

The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner system planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer system planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.

The Solar System also contains smaller objects.[f] The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations, some objects are large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be.[9][10] Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. The only certain dwarf planet is Pluto, with another trans-Neptunian object, Eris, expected to be, and the asteroid Ceres at least close to being a dwarf planet.[f] In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.

The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy in the Orion Arm, which contains most of the visible stars in the night sky. The nearest stars are within the so-called Local Bubble, with the closest Proxima Centauri at 4.25 light-years.</p>

<h2><u>SUN </u></h2>

<img src="./images/sun.jpg" alt="sun">



<p>The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses), which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star. This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.

The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.[63][64]

The Sun is a population I star; it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ("metals" in astronomical parlance) than the older population II stars.Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the first generation of stars had to die before the universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born later have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a planetary system because the planets form from the accretion of "metals".</p>

<h2><u>MERCURY</u></h2>
<img src="./images/mercury.jpg" alt="mercury">

<p>Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, and it is also the smallest planet in the solar system, only slightly larger than Earth's moon. Mercury has no atmosphere to protect it from the sun's relentless radiation and daytime surface temperatures can reach highs of 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius) before plummeting as low as minus 290 F (minus 180 C) at night. Mercury was named after the Roman messenger of the gods because of its speedy rotation around the sun. This small planet has no moons.</p>
<hr>
<h2><u>VENUS</u></h2>
<img src="./images/venus.jpg" alt="venus">

<p>Named after the Roman goddess of love, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Its atmosphere is a thick layer of mostly carbon dioxide gas that traps heat, allowing the planet's surface temperatures to reach a scorching 880 F (471 C). Venus is slightly smaller than Earth, and, like Earth’s outer core, it also has a core of molten iron. "Almost all the surface features of Venus are named for noteworthy Earth women — both mythological and real," says NASA. "A volcanic crater is named for Sacajawea, the Native American woman who guided Lewis and Clark's exploration. A deep canyon is named for Diana, Roman goddess of the hunt." Similar to Mercury, there are no moons orbiting Venus. </p>
<hr>
<h2><u>EARTH</u></h2>
<img src="./images/earth.jpg" alt="earth">

<p>The third rock from the sun, Earth is the only planet known to harbor life in the universe. Its habitability is linked to the presence of liquid water. Earth is located in what is known as the "Goldilocks Zone," orbiting at the ideal distance from the sun to have liquid water — if it were any closer, the water would evaporate into a gas and if Earth were farther away, the water would freeze. About 71% of our planet's surface is covered in water; and Earth's atmosphere protects the planet from solar radiation. Earth is the only planet not named after a god. Earth likely earned its name from the English and German words for "ground." Our blue planet is the largest of the four rocky planets in our solar system, and it has one moon. Scientists think Earth's moon was formed from a piece of Earth that broke off when a giant object smashed into young Earth</p>
<hr>
<h2><u>MARS</u></h2>
<img src="./images/mars.jpg" alt="mars">

<p>Mars is known as the Red Planet, due to the iron-rich dust that covers its surface and gives the planet a rusty color. This red color led the ancient Romans to name Mars after their god of war. The Red Planet is also home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. The planet has a thin atmosphere and without a thick protective shield, temperatures on Mars average around minus 80 F (minus 60 C). This makes it unlikely that liquid water — and thus life as we know it — could exist on the Martian surface, although scientists think that it once might have. Mars is currently the only known planet to be solely inhabited by robots, Quartz reported. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.</p>
<hr>
<h2><u>ASTEROID BELT</u></h2>
<img src="./images/ab.jpg" alt="asteroid belt">
<p>Asteroids except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as small Solar System bodies and are composed mainly of refractory rocky and metallic minerals, with some ice.They range from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres in size. Asteroids smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized), depending on different, somewhat arbitrary definitions.

The asteroid belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3 AU (340 and 490 million km; 210 and 310 million mi) from the Sun. It is thought to be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter.[96] The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter.[97] Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a thousandth of that of Earth. The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident</p>

<h2><u>JUPITER</u></h2>
<img src="./images/jupiter.jpg" alt="jupiter">

<p>Jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar system. Unlike its four neighbors closer to the sun, Jupiter is a gas giant, mainly made up of helium and hydrogen. It is named after the king of the Roman gods, who is also known as Zeus in the Greek pantheon. Jupiter is twice as big as all of the other planets in the solar system combined, and yet it also has the shortest day of any planet, taking 10 hours to turn about its axis. Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons, and its rings are faint and composed of dust. Deep in the planet's atmosphere, high pressure and temperature have compressed the hydrogen gas into a liquid, creating the largest ocean in the solar system, according to NASA.</p>
<hr>
<h2><u>SATURN</u></h2>
<img src="./images/saturn.jpg" alt="saturn">

<p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, is the second-largest in the solar system. The planet is best known for its prominent rings. Like Jupiter, Saturn is also a gas giant composed of helium and hydrogen, and it is the least dense of the planets. The planet's rings are made up of billions of ice particles and rocks, and Saturn's biggest ring, Phoebe, spans an area almost 7,000 times the planet itself. The ringed planet also has 82 moons, ranging in size from that of a sports field to the size of planet Mercury. One of Saturn's moons, Enceladus, is covered in an icy ocean which, according to astronomers, makes the moon a promising candidate for extraterrestrial life.</p>
<hr>
<h2><u>URANUS</u></h2>
<img src="./images/uranus.jpg" alt="uranus">

<p>Uranus was the first planet to be discovered using a telescope. It is also the only planet to be named after a Greek deity, Ouranos the sky god, rather than a Roman one. The seventh planet from the sun is an ice giant. It is composed of heavier elements than its gas giant neighbors, being a mixture of water, methane and ammonia ice. Also unlike other planets in the solar system, Uranus effectively orbits on its side (with its axis almost pointing toward the sun), and it "rolls" like a ball as it travels around the sun. Methane gas in Uranus' atmosphere makes the planet appear green-blue. Uranus also has 13 rings and 27 moons.</p>
<hr>
<h2><u>NEPTUNE</u></h2>
<img src="./images/neptune.jpg" alt="neptune">

<p>Scientists predicted Neptune existed before they observed it for the first time because of its effect on Uranus' orbit. NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft is the only mission to have visited the ice giant. Neptune, named after the Roman sea god, is so far away from the sun that it takes 4 hours for sunlight to reach the planet. (It takes about eight minutes for sunlight to reach Earth.) When the light arrives at Neptune, it is 900 times dimmer than what we see on Earth, according to NASA. About 80% of the Neptune's mass is made up of water, methane and ammonia surrounding a small, rocky core. Strong winds on the planet propel clouds of frozen methane at speeds of up to 1,200 mph (2,000 km/h). Neptune has 14 known moons, one of which was rediscovered after going missing for 20 years.</p>
